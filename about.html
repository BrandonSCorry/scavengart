					<p>ScavengArt is an interactive, social media supported, project based around gifting art. The

concept of ScavengArt allows artists from all levels and mediums to hide work in order to be found. This

concept is based around gifting while also creating a connection to artists that would not normally have

been discovered. Through the utilization of a social media market ScavengArt and its participants can

reach a large audience across all areas.</p>

<p>ScavengArt encourages artists of all disciplines and mediums to “gift” art through the concept of

a scavenger hunt. By utilizing the fast networks of social media artists can leave pictures, hash tags, and

descriptive clues to where the work is hidden. Each piece is accompanied by a small message that allows

the discoverer to know what they found and where to learn more about the process and artist. Anyone can

participate as long as the pieces are original (writing, paintings, jewelry, or sculptures) and are left in

appropriate places (work cannot be left on private property or other non-public access places). The artist

leaves the work in a weather sealed bag and provides information about ScavengArt. Artists can leave

work anonymously or provide their personal information as well. Once a piece is hidden the artist then

promotes their piece using either Facebook, #ScavengArt, @ScavengArt, on Twitter and Instagram.</p>



<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of ScavengArt will always be about gifting free art. ScavengArt hopes to reach all

areas, levels, and participants within the arts community and beyond to spread the gift of art and offer

opportunities for artists to be discovered.</p>
					
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In April 2014, a Washington, DC area local artist, Jennifer Droblyn, decided she needed to flush

out some old small pieces. Instead of pushing for sales or giving the work away she came up with a

creative way to distribute her work to the community. The idea of ScavengArt was born. Within an

evening a Facebook page was created that allowed her to post pictures and clues to where she had hidden

her small paintings for strangers to search for or stumble upon. During the summer of 2015, the

ScavengArt idea was given to me and built upon as part of my work for Savannah College of Art and

Design Masters of Arts Administration. The plans designed were a White Paper in my Business Writing

class titled “5 Benefits of Incorporating ScavengArt into Society” and a mock business financial plan for

Financial Management and Marketing. Creating Instagram and Twitter pages ScavengArt gained over

one hundred followers, around 5 participating artists, and an interview on Soundcloud done by Jennifer

Droblyn. Art work appeared in states across the US including North Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada as pieces

made their way to the Burning Man festival made and distributed by various artists.</p>
